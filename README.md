# what-is-markdown
A quick description of Markdown, its uses, and how to get started.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a text-based document that uses a lightweight markup language.
It was created by John Gruber in 2004.

Markdown is different than WYSIWYG documents such as Microsoft Word. In a Word document your edits and presentation is instant and visible graphically on the page. Markdown is a mix of text and simple markup, but it can be rendered/previewed/converted/saved to see the graphical representations of the simple markup you write. Since Markdown files are text-based they are available on all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux, ios, Android, etc). This differs from Microsoft Word whose file format is not easily available on all platforms. Recent versions of Microsoft Office 365 has taken their product online in attempt to broaden their market to other platforms. However, Office 365 still is limited by an available internet connection.

Markdown can be used to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.

## Creating and Editing Markdown Files

Markdown has a fairly simple syntax to create documents. It uses the ".md" file extension and is a simple text-based document that you can edit and preview in many code editors such as VSCode. To get you started, you can visit the following web page, which is simple guide to some common syntax.

Markdown Guide [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

For example it shows you how to type `# My level one heading` to display a top level heading and `## My level two heading` for a level 2 heading.

VSCode can aid in writing Markdown. For example, you can simply copy/cut and paste images into the document,
or type out the syntax by hand:  
An exclamation ! followed by [alt text] followed by (imagename.extension)  

`![alt text](some-image.png)`  

## Viewing Markdown files

To view a graphical representation of a Markdown file in VSCode you can right click on the file and select "Open Preview". If you prefer a shortcut key combination VSCode offers this as well.

- Mac: Shift + Command + V
